This project successfully identified and forecasted hashtag trends using a combination of data analysis, visualization, and predictive modelling techniques. By integrating Python-based pre-processing and forecasting with interactive Power BI dashboards, the study provided stakeholders with actionable insights into current and predicted hashtag performance. These insights can help brands, marketers, and content creators align their strategies with emerging trends, ultimately enhancing audience engagement and reach.
The approach adopted in this project emphasizes accessibility, reproducibility, and adaptability, making it feasible for smaller teams or organizations without access to large-scale computing infrastructure. Although the methodology did not incorporate resource-heavy machine learning architectures, it demonstrated that lightweight solutions like Facebook Prophet can still yield meaningful results when applied to well-prepared datasets.
However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The absence of real-time data streams meant that forecasts were based on static historical datasets, limiting responsiveness to sudden viral spikes. Additionally, the lack of raw textual data prevented the incorporation of sentiment analysis, which could provide a deeper understanding of audience perception. Prophet’s forecasting strength in identifying long-term seasonal patterns also means it is less suited to capturing abrupt,
short-term fluctuations caused by breaking events or sudden influencer endorsements.
Future enhancements could include:
• Real-time API integration from platforms such as Twitter/X, Instagram, or TikTok to enable continuous trend monitoring and up-to-date forecasting.
• Hybrid modelling approaches that combine Prophet with advanced deep learning methods like LSTM or transformer-based architectures for improved short-term accuracy.
• NLP-powered sentiment analysis to complement quantitative engagement metrics with qualitative insights on audience emotions and attitudes toward trending topics.
• Multimodal trend analysis, incorporating both text and visual content to capture richer trend signals.
• Automated alert systems that notify stakeholders when specific hashtags show early signs of going viral, enabling proactive marketing responses.
By addressing these areas, the framework developed in this project could evolve into a robust, real-time trend intelligence platform, supporting data-driven decision-making in fast-moving digital environments.
